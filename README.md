# AndroidTutorial-JSON-Retrofit
 
Get started with Android + Kotlin JSON & Retrofit with this simple starter project

* View JSON Response products in a recyclerview via Retrofit API call
* Product:Â https://tutorialsapi.herokuapp.com/api/products
* You can view the JSON response by hitting the 'products' endpoint

* Just in case the endpoint is down (if the Heroku dyno has been domant for a while it goes to sleep so to say), then below is the raw JSON. Just copy it and save it as a .json file then point the app url to it
